          Hi, I am SEENISELVAM B from Virudhunagar, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Sri Krishna College of Technology.
          </p>
          <p>
          I have developed a website for my native church, <strong>CSI Immanuel Church</strong>, to share information, events, and church history with the community.
          I have also completed an internship at <strong>Phoneix Softech</strong>, where I gained hands-on experience in <strong>Basic Java Programming</strong>.
